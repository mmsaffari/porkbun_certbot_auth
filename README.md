# Porkbun scripts for certbot

Issuing wildcard domain certificates with certbot, when your dns server is not one of the famous ones like CloudFlare, DigitalOcean, etc., can be a cumbersome task. Here I will try to provide a walkthrough for when you are managing your domain's DNS records on https://porkbun.com.
There are plugins for PorkBunäs DNS challenge on `snap` or `PyPI` but connecting certbot to those plugins didn't really work for me, and moreover, why should I install more beta or RC packages when it can be solved using a couple of script files?
Let's get our hands dirty!

## Prerequisites

These scripts use `jq` to get porkbun's `record_id` of the challenge record.

```bash
apt install jq -y
```

## Configure porkbun's API

1. Log into your porkbun account.
2. From the top-right `"ACCOUNT"` menu, select `"API Access"`.
3. At the bottom of the page, just the footer section, there is a text box that reads `"API Key Title"`. Write something meaningful, like `"CertbotDnsToken"`, in the box.
4. On success you'll see a green box with two significant pieces of information. Take a note of your token's `"API KEY"` and `"Secret Key"`.
5. From the `"ACCOUNT"` menu on the top right, navigate to `"Domain Management"`.
6. Find your domain and open its `"Details"` pane.
7. Enable `"API ACCESS"` (Green is enabled. Red is disabled.)

## Configure Certbot

1. Create a folder like `/usr/local/etc/certbot`
2. Copy `porkbun_cleanup.sh` and `porkbun_auth.sh` into that folder. They should already be executable, if they are not run `chmod a+x /usr/local/etc/certbot/porkbun_*`.
3. Make a copy of `.env.example` and set up your `API_KEY` and `SECRET_API_KEY` to the values you received when you created a porkbun API token in the previous section.

> Note: if you encounter errors of the type `Incorrect TXT record "<random token>" at _acme-challenge.example.com` try increasing AUTH_SLEEP in `.env`.

## Get your certificates

That's all! You should be able to fetch a new wildcard certificate for you domain as easy as running the following command. **Remeber to replace your email and domain names before running it**.

```bash
certbot certonly \
    --manual \
    --preferred-challenges dns \
    --manual-auth-hook /usr/local/etc/certbot/porkbun_auth.sh \
    --manual-cleanup-hook /usr/local/etc/certbot/porkbun_cleanup.sh \
    --agree-tos \
    -m youremail@yourdomain.tld \
    -d example.com \
    -d *.example.com
```

Since you've provided those hooks, certbot will auto-renew your certificates for you.

Viel Spaß!
